## Introduction

In a perfect world, you would be able to click one button or type one command and all your problems would be solved. We don't live in a perfect world and we don't have one button or one command to solve all your problems, but we're pretty close. 

It's almost impossible to configure and implement a solution to fit every customer, every environment, and every situation. Hopefully this reference architecture will be able to provide you a great starting point to apply to your customer, your environment, and your situation.
